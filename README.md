# Distributed Energy Resource Investigation and Valuation Engine (DERIVE)
DERIVE is a simulation engine that allows the value of a consumer's behind-the-meter 
distributed energy resources (DERs) to be explored for that consumer. The simulation 
engine seeks to minimize the consumer's total electricity bill, which includes costs 
from utility tariffs and benefits from utility, market, and regulator programs. By 
optimally dispatching the consumers' resources, the value of the DERs is able to be 
determined by comparing scenarios with different combinations of value streams and 
asset sizes.
